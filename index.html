I'm an Astrophysics PhD student at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh working on galaxy evolution, in particular the star-formation histories of quiescent galaxies. My research involves applying techniques from the field of data science to large and noisy astronomical datasets. In particular I am interested in Bayesian statistical methods (e.g. nested sampling), machine learning and numerical optimisation.

I work with data from telescopes across the world and in space. I am a core member of <a href="http://vandels.inaf.it">VANDELS</a>, a large European Southern Observatory public survey on the Very Large Telescope in Chile. I am supervised by Professors Ross McLure and James Dunlop.

I recently published Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation, or BAGPIPES, a Python tool for generating complex model galaxy spectra and fitting these to spectroscopic and photometric observational data. You can download the code and read the documentation at  <a href="https://bagpipes.readthedocs.io">https://bagpipes.readthedocs.io</a>, or view the source code and examples at <a href="https://github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes">https://www.github.com/ACCarnall/bagpipes</a>
