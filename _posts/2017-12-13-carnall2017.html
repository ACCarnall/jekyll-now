The first paper I've written as part of my PhD was <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04452">published on arXiv</a> today after three months of writing! In it we report the results of an analysis of the star-formation histories of a sample of almost 10,000 massive quiescent galaxies from <a href="http://ultravista.org">UltraVISTA</a> across a wide range of redshifts.

<p>
We find that the shapes of our star-formation histories fall into three categories which we identify with different quenching mechanisms. We also investigate how the star-formation histories vary with stellar mass, confirming the mass-accelerated evolution (downsizing) trend, and a trend towards more rapid quenching at higher stellar masses. However, our results suggest that the latter is a natural consequence of mass-accelerated evolution, rather than a change in quenching physics.
</p>
<p>
The majority of our sample exhibit star-formation histories which rise gradually then quench relatively rapidly, over 1 - 2 Gyr. This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. At z > 1 we also find a class of objects with SFHs which rise and fall very rapidly, with quenching timescales of < 1 Gyr, consistent with quasar-mode AGN feedback. Finally, at z < 1 we find a population with SFHs which quench more slowly than they rise, over > 3 Gyr, which we speculate to be the result of diminishing overall cosmic gas supply.
</p>
<p>
We also look into how well different functional forms used to model star-formation histories perform when fitting realistic simulated galaxies from the Mufasa simulation. We find that the double-power-law functional form significantly outperforms the standard exponentially declining star-formation histories often used in these kinds of analyses.
