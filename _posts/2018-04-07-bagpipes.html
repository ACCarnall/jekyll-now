<p>
BAGPIPES is a Bayesian spectral fitting code, designed to model the emission from galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the microwave regimes, and to fit these models to arbitrary combinations of spectroscopic and photometric observational data using nested sampling. BAGPIPES is written purely in the Python programming language and considerable effort has been made to make the API as intuitive and user-friendly as possible.
